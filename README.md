# noeq-lang
A purely conceptual language - not compilable - to show how a language wouldn't have any equality operators AT ALL

![What if someone made a programming language with exactly zero equality operators?  You have to do everything with the inequality operators: <, >, !=, <!, >!](./2021-11-05_23-46.png)

The rest of the syntax is also custom

if you want to make a way to run this code, feel free. I designed it so it would be semi-functional to be more realistic.
